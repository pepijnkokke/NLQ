### Thesis

- The reason that delimited control is important in the context of
  linguistics has to do with the following:

  "While *any complete program* that uses [operations such as
  Felleisen's C or shift and reset] can be *globally transformed* to a
  purely functional program [..] the additional expressiveness of the
  control operators comes from the fact that no *local
  transformations* of *program fragments* using control operators is
  possible." (Ariola, Herbelin and Sabry)

  (Does it really? I mean, we *could* just use these operators in the
  lexicon and only translate to, for instance, pure intuitionistic
  lambda calculus when we have a complete derivation. So no, it
  doesn't. But it's still a kickass quote.)
