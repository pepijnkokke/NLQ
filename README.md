### Design

#### Module structure

There are two axes along which I classify my logics. The first of
these is the axis of structure. In this axis, the different logics are
based upon the presence and absence of three axioms: *contraction*,
*weakening* and *exchange*. These axioms give us---respectively---the
ability to duplicate information, to forget information and to reorder
the values in our context.

This last axiom (of exchange) can be further taken apart into
*commutativity* and *associativity* of the context building
operator---usually $(\cdot\;,\cdot)$.

Usually the axis is presented as follows:

                        unrestricted
                           / || \
          (no contraction)/  ||  \(no weakening)
                         /   ||   \
                   affine    ||    relevant
                         \   ||   /
            (no weakening)\  ||  /(no contraction)
                           \ || /
                           linear
                           / || \
        (no commutativity)/  ||  \(no associativity)
                         /   ||   \
          non-commutative    ||    non-associative
                         \   ||   /
        (no associativity)\  ||  /(no commutativity)
                           \ || /
                           ordered

While there are technically other possibilities (by dropping exchange
before contraction and weakening) the presented logics are most
thoroughly studied.
However, for this paper, we will *only* deal with logics in the
*unrestricted*, *linear* and *ordered* categories.

The second axis is roughly spun by *intuitionistic* versus *classical*
logics.
