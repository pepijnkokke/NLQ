# Linguistic Examples

  * Scope ambiguity

     a. Mary wants everyone to leave.

     For instance, if LOWER applies to the embedded clause everyone to
     leave before it combines with the matrix verb wants, then the
     scope of the quantifier will be limited to the embedded clause,
     and the interpretation of the sentence will be:
     $$wants(\forall x.leave\;x)\;m$$
     In this interpretation, Mary has a single desire: that everyone
     leave. But if LOWER does not apply until the end of the
     derivation, a different interpretation emerges:
     $$\forall x.wants(leave\;x)\;m$$
     In this interpretation, Mary has a multiplicity of desires: for
     each person x, Mary wants x to leave.

     The standard judgment in the literature is that a tensed variant
     of this sentence (Mary said everyone left) is not ambiguous, and
     the scope of the quantifier is trapped inside of the embedded
     clause. However, verbs with infinitival complements are
     ambiguous, at least for some speakers.


  * Binding and crossover

     a.    Everyone~i~ loves his~i~ mother.
     b. \* His~i~ mother loves everyone~i~.

     and

     a.    Which of his~i~ relatives does every man~i~ love the most?
     b.    The relative of his~i~ that every man~i~ loves most is his mother.

  * Scope-taking adjectives

     a.    Ann and Bill read the same book.
